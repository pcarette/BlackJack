# The BlackJack

Hey anon, let me introduce you the first project I made in JavaScript. It's BlackJack, the game that can be found in casinos. 

If you don't know the rules, i could let you google it, but here's basically what you need to know : 


* You will play against an algorithm (against casino IRL).
* It's a card game where you have a shuffled deck.
  When it's your turn you can pick cards 1 by 1.
* The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible, without exceeding it.
* The Jack, the Queen and the King worth 10.
* the Axis worth 11 at first, then when your score is above 10 it worths 1. 
* You play first, trying to get the closest without lose.
* Then it's the Dealer's (the computer's) turn. He will try to beat your score, but not exceeding 21.
* At the end of the turn, we compare your scores, the closest to 21 wins.
